            Hello, I'm a junior at the University of Connecticut. 
                I am interested in mobile and web development and I'm seeking out opportunities in these areas. 
                I love the possibilities available with these types of development and I want to use what I learn to create a business. 
                Outside of coding, I love watching soccer, anime, playing video games once in a while, and hanging out with my friends. 
                I hope you like what you see on my page!</p>
